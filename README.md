# Fibonacci Implementations Comparison

This project demonstrates four different implementations of Fibonacci sequence calculation with varying time complexities:

1. `solve1`: Naive recursive (exponential time O(2^n))
2. `solve2`: Memoization (top-down DP, linear time O(n) with O(n) space)
3. `solve3`: Iterative (linear time O(n) with constant space O(1))
4. `solve4`: Matrix exponentiation (logarithmic time O(log n))
